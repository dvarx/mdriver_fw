# `mdriver` Controller CPU1

## Current sensor sensitivities

- The `mdriver` can be equipped with different current sensors `TMCS1100AX` with `X={1,2,3,4}`. The sensors have different sensitivities and this sensitivity is defined as `I_SENSITIVITY` in `mdriver_cpu1/mdriver_hw_defs.h`. Change the corresponding values to the appropriate value before flashing `CPU1`.
